workflow:
Very simple system to get running, I didn't have to fight with anything, created my own diskdef, and it worked the first try! (scanned with existing diskdef to find one that read the dir, then tweaked it from there).
load image with HxC, export to .IMG, edit with cpmtoolsgui, reload raw image with HxC, export to .IMD 
just rename file you wish to autorun to STARTUP.COM 

mame command:

mame x1 -flop1 "[path to disk image]" -skip_gameinfo -natural -window -nomaximize
