terminal emulation: ANSI, kinda, 
only 65 characters wide, looking for an 80 column emulator. dsp314.com looks like it supports 80 column, but when anything is chosen, it freezes in mame(2016) and mame270.

red box warning can't be skipped and you must press F6 at startup, haven't had any luck automating either.

disk images: SteinBlume:

image from mame software list, seems to be the only cp/m image available for this system.

profile.sub works

F4 for ctrl-c
