disk images: Cpmtools(gui) & HcX:

diskdef bw12
  seclen 256
  tracks 40
  sectrk 18
  blocksize 2048
  maxdir 64
  skew 1
  boottrk 2
  os 2.2
end

HxC image setting:
40 tracks
1 side
18 sectors
256 sector size
0 sector id
1 interleave
0 skew
0 format value
255 gap3
0 pregap

images are from mame softwarelist
there is cpm2.2 for bw12 & bw14(use bw12 for autostart)
there is cpm3 for bm14, file xfers don't work (yet, so no images so far)

workflow: load IMD in HxC, save .img, xfer files onto .img with cpmtoolsgui, load raw image in HcX, export IMD, test with emulator

Couldn't get submit to work, but autorun is built-in. Rename .com file to autorun.com.
Image can be hexedited to autorun basic by renaming mbasic.com and the *.bas file to equal 6 letters (+ a space = 7) ie "MB MENU" and hexedit replacing AUTORUN.

MAME command line:

mame bw12 -flop1 "[path to disk image]" -window -nomaximize -autoboot_delay 5 -autoboot_command \n\n\n

mame2016 hangs, works in mame270
