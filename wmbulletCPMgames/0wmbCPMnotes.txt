terminal: uses mame default terminals, they have no terminal codes supported (that I know of), won't run the classics: aliens catchum ladder etc.

disk images: Cpmtools(gui) & HcX:

diskdef wav2
  seclen 1024
  tracks 160
  sectrk 5
  blocksize 2048
  maxdir 128
  skew 1
  boottrk 2
  os 2.2
end

HxC image setting:

40 tracks
2 sides
5 sectors per track
1024 sector size
1 sector id
1 interleave
1 skew
250 rpm

images are from mame softlist
there is cpm2.2 for wmb file xfers don't work (yet, so no images so far)
there is cpm3 for wmb that works. 

workflow: load IMD in HxC, save .img, xfer files onto .img with cpmtoolsgui, load raw image in HcX, export IMD, test with emulator

submit works, with profile.sub

MAME command line:

mame wmbullet -window -nomaximize -u55:0 525dd -flop1 "[path to disk image]"

(slot is required because defaults don't match each other or disk)
mame2016 hangs, works in mame270
