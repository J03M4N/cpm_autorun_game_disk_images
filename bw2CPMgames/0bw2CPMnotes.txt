Disk image from mame bw2 software list.

Workflow: typical, load initial image with HxC, export .IMG, use cpmtoolsgui to edit .IMG, reload raw image in HxC, export to .IMD

hexedited initial image to support "SUBMIT PROFILE", works fine.
.SUB file must be padded, extract and edit PROFILE.SUB from disk.
This method caused the disk error in mame174 tying to write $$$.sub to the image, changing from profile.sub to direct loading DID solve this. (using MFM disk format type would also solve this.)

MAME COMMAND LINE:

mame bw2 -flop1 "[path to disk image]" -skip_gameinfo -natural -window -nomaximize -autoboot_delay 3 -autoboot_command \n

mame174 disk error (looks like it's caused by trying to write $$$.sub. direct autorun would fix)
mame270 works
