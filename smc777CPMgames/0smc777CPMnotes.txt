disk image from mame softlist

workflow: had to remount for "read this image write to another" dialogue, rename to .MFM. ran setup to set colors, cursor and autostart, set autostart to "SUBMIT PROFILE" works perfect, just edit "PROFILE.SUB" (needs to be padded as usual in cpm2.2). then loaded the newly created .MFM with HxC and exported as .IMD Used new .IMD as source disk for standard workflow

mame command line:
