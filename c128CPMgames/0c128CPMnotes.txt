Terminal Emulation: enhanced ADM-3A with color support

disk images: ctools.

ctools supports .D64 and .D71 images. for .D81 I used an existing image in VICE emulator and copied files from .D71s prepared by ctools.

uses cpm3.0 (plus), so profile.sub support is built in, just edit "PROFILE.SUB" for autostart.

disk image from:

mame startup: 
mame c128 -flop1 "[path to cpmbootdisk]" -ui_active -window -numscreens 1 -screen0 "\\.\DISPLAY2" -view "screen 0 standard"

vice startup:
x128 -80col "[path to cpmbootdisk]"
