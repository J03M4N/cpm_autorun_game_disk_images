diskimage: must be cp/m for softcard, haven't been able to get applicard working.
mame requires softcard in slot 4.
had to stick with .DSK format, couldn't get .IMD to boot. Didn't try very hard.

MAME minimal command line:

mame apple2e -sl4 softcard -flop1 [path to softcard CP/M boot disk image]
